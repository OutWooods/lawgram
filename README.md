# README

This is me following the tutorial from [https://www.devwalks.com/blog/](https://www.devwalks.com/blog/) as a way to learn about the different functionalities of rails, and some useful gems.

Its absolutely excellent to go through, but I'd reccomend trying to build something simpler yourself before doing this. Its consolidated alot of my learning and deepened my understanding of how rails actually does stuff.
